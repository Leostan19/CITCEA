COMMENTS on the model:
- Deterministic model. All inputs are known and all years in the project lifetime are exactly the same
- External grid connection with Spanish market.
    Tariff 2.0TD cannot have penalisations.
    Options to define grid costs: fix/constant for all hours, by each tariff period, based on downloaded spot market annual data, from hourly profile uploaded.
    Hired power can be optimised or fixed as given by each tariff period.
    Injection to the grid is optimised based on client willingness and that the total PV installation is lower than the limit (here we can put a limit
    of 100 kW for bureaucratic issues or a high enough value to not consider it).
- Multiple loads can be defined given their annual power profile (including EV with immediate charging).
     A single EV can also be built based on daily profile probability distributions, and can be considered as immediate charging or smart charging. (<-- to improve)
- BESS calendar aging through SOCmax(t) and cycle aging through an adjustable degradation cost (â‚¬/kWh) for charging and discharging
- Load not supplied defined for each bus, and it has a fixed cost
- Operational and replacement costs are actualized --> same formula as NPV: sum(cost/(1+disc_rate)**y for y in range(y_ini,L_prj,y_step)), with disc_rate=0
- ROI and payback constraints are currently disabled, making the model LP (without flexibility requests)!!!
- (internal) System grid approaches:
    Economic dispatch.
    DC-OPF. Single voltage level, as no transformers are modelled. Grid indicators (losses or other costs) not implemented
    AC-OPF not implemented
- Separate systems can be considered as connected to different buses
- If more than one external grid connection, PV limit to inject is supposed as the sum of PV for all buses and injection decision will affect all external grid connections
- Converters are not directly implemented
